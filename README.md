<h1 align="center">Local Liverpool</h1> 

## Overview

Covid-19 and multiple lockdowns have affected independent business’ and I wanted to try and offer a solution to help more people to support independent business’.
As people are slowly allowed back to travel, I believe a great way to support them is to guide tourism to their way via the platform Local.
Local uses local bloggers and reviewers to help promote these great independent’s which allows the visitor to sample the new town or city like a local supporting local independent business’ in the process.
The independent’s can use the site to offer discounts for the customer if they wish.
